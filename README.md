# ViewTube - Server Side

## Overview
ViewTube Server Side is the backend infrastructure for a video-sharing platform, enabling functionalities such as user authentication, video management, comments handling, and more. This server-side code complements the ViewTube frontend built with React, providing a robust backend architecture for seamless video playback and user interaction.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Video Management**: CRUD operations for uploading, updating, and deleting videos.
- **Comments Handling**: Management of video comments, including creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.
- **Likes and Views Tracking**: Tracking user likes on videos and view counts.
- **File Uploads**: Handling video file uploads and thumbnail storage.
- **Integration with Frontend**: APIs integrated with ViewTube frontend for seamless data flow and interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend server environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js, simplifying routing and middleware management.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data, video metadata, and comments.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Token-based authentication mechanism for secure API endpoints.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, used for file uploads.

## Prerequisites
Before running the server-side application, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 14.x or later)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **MongoDB** (running instance or connection string provided in environment variables)

### Working Process
The development process for the server-side code involved collaborative effort and systematic approach:
- **Task Assignment**: Each team member was assigned specific tasks such as user authentication, video management, or comments handling.
- **Implementation**: We focused on robust backend logic implementation using Express.js and MongoDB, ensuring scalability and performance.
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with the frontend was ensured through RESTful APIs, enabling smooth data flow between client and server.
- **Testing and Refinement**: Rigorous testing was conducted to validate API endpoints, data handling, and security measures. Refinements were made based on testing results and feedback.

By adhering to best practices, effective collaboration, and rigorous testing, we successfully developed a scalable backend for ViewTube, complementing the frontend's user-centric features and enhancing overall user experience.
